# Subtyping of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease based on pre-diagnostic clinical information: a deep learning study with external validation, prognostic relevance, and genetic explanation


This repository contains code to apply contrastive learning on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and generate patient subtypes. The approach leverages a Transformer-based model fine-tuned using a contrastive loss on sequential EHR data. The code computes patient embeddings, clusters them using KMeans, and calculates the optimal k using prediction strength.

> **Note:** Due to data privacy restrictions, the original vocabulary and model files used in our research cannot be shared. In this repository, a Hugging Face BERT model is used as a placeholder. Please replace it with your own model and vocabulary if necessary.

## Overview

### Step 1: Generate cohort and EHR data
- **`cohort_generation.py`** — Generate a disease cohort based on your requirements.  
  Examples are in the `cohort/` folder.  
  *Note: Due to privacy restrictions, the datasets used in our experiments cannot be shared.*

  - **`customize.py`** — Contains case definitions and related logic. Edit as needed.  
  - **`code_identify.ipynb`** — (Updated Sep 2025) Inspect and summarise the distribution of disease-definition codes.

- **`ehr_generation.py`** — After cohort creation, build pre-diagnosis EHR histories (model inputs).  
  Example EHRs are provided in `toy_data_EHR/`.  
  *Note: The production EHR data cannot be shared due to privacy restrictions.*

---

### Step 2: Train and evaluate the clustering model
- **`finetune.py`** — Fine-tune a Transformer-based model on EHR data using contrastive learning.  
- **`evaluate.py`** — Compute patient embeddings with the trained model, cluster them with K-Means, and generate visualisations (e.g., t-SNE).

---

### Step 3: Analyse clinical profiles and explore genetic signals
- **`analyze.py`** — Produce survival curves, hospitalisation rates, pre-disease heatmaps, and symptom summaries by cluster.  
- **`SNP_AD.ipynb`** — Explore cluster-specific genetic differences (SNP-level analyses).


## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- MulticoreTSNE

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn MulticoreTSNE

## Usage

### Fine-Tuning the Model

Run the following command to fine-tune the model on your EHR data:

```bash
python finetune.py --disease AD --cohort_dir AD_data --experiment_dir AD --model_name cl_maskage_b16 --batch_size 16 --seed 12345 --device 1
```

#### Parameter Explanations:

- `--disease`: Specifies the disease label for training.
- `--cohort_dir `: Directory containing the  cohort data.
- `--experiment_dir `: Directory to save the experiment outputs, including checkpoints and logs.
- `--model_name `: The designated name for the trained model.
- `--batch_size 16`: Batch size used during training.
- `--seed 12345`: Seed value for reproducibility.
- `--device 1`: GPU device identifier for training.

### Evaluating the Trained Model and Generating Subtypes
For around 40k patients, it cost 4 hours on a single V100 node.

After training, generate patient subtypes using the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --disease AD --cohort_dir AD_data --model_name AD_model --experiment_dir AD --k 5 --fold_idx 4 --device 0 
```
